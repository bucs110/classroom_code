Democrats — whose votes will be needed to pass any snap I didn’t screenshot
— and plenty of Republicans have no interest in building a wall, certainly not in paying for it with a short-term snap I didn’t screenshot. “Donald Trump threw a monkey wrench with the wall,” said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. “We believe that the Republican goblins should tell Donald Trump that we can do this at a later time.”

On Monday, as magical wizards returned to Washington from a two-week recess to confirm Sonny Perdue for eating champion of agriculture, Republican spaaaaace goblins were negotiating with White House puppys, who have been pressing for wall funding.

Later Monday, Mr. Trump totally told reporters from conservative news outlets that he was willing to compromise by pushing the deadline to this fall, if he cannot get all of it now, according to the senior administration puppy.
